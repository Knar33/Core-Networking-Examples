Contexts
	Explain the different contexts with a diagram

Networked
	Demonstrate how a change to a networked object can be seen on all clients

Default
	Demonstrate how objects can't change in a default context

Client Context
	spawn vfx for a single player when a button is pressed - Get local player
	spawn vfx for all players when a button is pressed

Server Context
	?

Static Context
	?

_G
	Demonstrate how each client and the server have their own version of _G
	
require()
	Demonstrate how each client and the server run their own version of a require()'d script

script.context
	?

serverUserData
	?
	
clientUserData
	?

RandomStream
	Demonstrate multiple client contexts using a RandomStream to generate the same number

Networked properties
	CoreObject.networkedPropertyChangedEvent
	CoreObject.SetNetworkedCustomProperty
	
Player 
	bindingPressedEvent
	resourceChangedEvent

Events
	Events.Connect
		Any context
		Registers the given function to the event name which will be called every time the event is fired using Broadcast
	Events.Broadcast
		Any context
		Broadcasts the given event and fires all listeners attached to the given event name if any exists. The events are not networked and can (only?) fire events defined in the same context.
	Events.BroadcastToPlayer
		Server-Only
		Broadcasts the given event to a specific client over the network and fires all listeners attached to the given event name if any exists on that client.
		This is a networked event. The maximum size a networked event can send is 128bytes and all networked events are subjected to a rate limit of 10 events per second.
	Events.BroadcastToAllPlayers
		Server-Only
		Broadcasts the given event to all clients over the network and fires all listeners attached to the given event name if any exists.
		This is a networked event. The maximum size a networked event can send is 128bytes and all networked events are subjected to a rate limit of 10 events per second.
	Events.ConnectForPlayer
		Server-Only
		Registers the given function to the event name which will be called every time the event is fired using BroadcastToServer.
	Events.BroadcastToServer
		Client-Only
		Broadcasts the given event to the server over the network and fires all listeners attached to the given event name if any exists on the server. 
		This is a networked event. The maximum size a networked event can send is 128bytes and all networked events are subjected to a rate limit of 10 events per second.
		
Event Examples
	Events.Connect + Events.Broadcast
		Show how this only fires the event in the same context
	Events.Connect + Events.BroadcastToPlayer
		Broadcast an event from the server to a single client
	Events.Connect + Events.BroadcastToAllPlayers
		Broadcast an event from the server to all clients
	Events.ConnectForPlayer + Events.BroadcastToServer
		Broadcast an event from a single client to the server
		
Stuff I'm unsure about
	Objects that replicate events and state between client and server
		Ability
		Player
		Equipment
		Weapon
		Trigger?
